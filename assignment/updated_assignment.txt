Ques : 

Create a web application to take notes and store it.
The application UI has two parts. 
- Note creation block where user enters title(text) and a note(description text). On submit of the above fields the note should be saved and shown in list of notes
- List of notes which show the list of notes (Each element in the list will have the title, note and option to modify or delete the note)

One need to take title and note as one entity from user and on submit need to display it in the form of a list.(similar to comment on blog)
- A user can enter any number of entity(title+note)
- No duplicate entry (with respect to title)
- We should be able to modify and delete each entity.
- Use only HTML,CSS and JavaScript(please try to build application withount any JS frameworks/Library and server side languages)
- Data should be retained in browser when user reload the page
- Design is up to you. Use any simple design which you think is best

Good to have
- Search the list on basis of title or content
- Object oriented code
- Semantic code and responsive design
